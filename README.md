 USAGE NOTES:
#############

1.
THIS TOOL IS VASTLY MORE USEFUL WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH 'STRICT COMPILATION MODE'
IN FACT, IT WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED TO FACILIATE BRINGING LEGACY CODE INTO 'STRICT' COMPLIANCE

2.
UNDECLARED VARIABLES IN WHICH DATA IS ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC CHUNK, FOR EXAMPLE:

     put "John" into line 1 of tUserData

WILL *NOT* BE DETECTED BY THE AUTO-DECLARER
IT IS (IN GENERAL) A BETTER AND SAFER PRACTICE TO DECLARE THESE VARIABLES AS EMPTY BEFORE USING THEM:

     put empty into tUserData
     put "John" into line 1 of tUserData

3.
VARIABLE DECLARATIONS WILL BE COMBINED BY SCOPE, IE SCRIPT-LOCALS WILL BE COLLECTED
AT THE TOP OF THE SCRIPT, HANDLER-LOCALS AT THE TOP OF THE HANDLER, ETC

4.
HANDLER NAMES THAT ARE PREPENDED WITH FOUR (4) UNDERSCORES WILL BE STYLED AS
'CODE FOLDERS', AND WILL THEREFORE IGNORE NORMAL HANDLER SPACING RULES,
ABUTTING DIRECTLY AGAINST THE HANDLER FOLLOWING THEM

5.
THERE IS A KNOWN PERFORMANCE PENALTY OF 10X-15X FOR CLEANING CODE IN LIVECODE 7 AND 8
THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING ADDRESSED AT AN ENGINE LEVEL BY THE LIVECODE TEAM

 SETTINGS:
##########

 kCC_AlphabetizeHandlers
     HANDLERS' ORDER OF APPEARANCE WILL BE RE-SORTED ALPHABETICALLY; NOTE THAT THIS CAN PRODUCE
     UNINTUITIVE RESULTS WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 'COLLAPSE' COMMENT ORGANIZATION MODE

 kCC_CommentOrganizationMode
     * COMMENTS WRITTEN OUTSIDE OF INDIVIDUAL HANDLERS CAN BE HANDLED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS *
     REMOVE   - COMMENTS OUTSIDE OF HANDLERS WILL BE REMOVED ENTIRELY (DEFAULT; THIS IS THE FASTEST MODE)
     COMBINE  - COMMENTS WILL BE COMBINED AND MOVED TO THE TOP OF THE SCRIPT
     COMPACT  - COMMENTS WILL BE STRIPPED OF EXCESS WHITE SPACE AND LEFT IN PLACE INTERSTITIALLY

 kCC_EnforceNamingRules
     * VARIABLES MUST COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING RULES (PLUS A SLIGHTLY LONGER CLEANING) *
       - HANDLER-LOCAL VARIABLES START WITH T
       - SCRIPT-LOCAL VARIABLES START WITH S
       - CONSTANTS START WITH K
       - GLOBALS START WITH G
       - PARAMS START WITH P IF PASSED BY COPY
       - PARAMS START WITH R IF EXPLICITLY PASSED BY REFERENCE
     * NON-COMPLIANCE WILL RESULT IN THE CODE BEING MODIFIED TO THROW A COMPILE-TIME ERROR *

 kCC_HandlerSpacing
     THE NUMBER OF LINES SEPARATING DISTINCT HANDLERS AND SCRIPT-SCOPED COMMENT BLOCKS

 kCC_MaxCharsPerVarLine
     THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS A LINE OF NON-LITERAL DECLARATIONS TAKE BEFORE RE-FLOWING ONTO THE NEXT LINE

 kCC_RescopeConstants
     HANDLER-LOCAL CONSTANTS WILL BE RE-SCOPED TO SCRIPT-LOCAL

 kCC_RescopeGlobals
     HANDLER-LOCAL GLOBALS WILL BE RE-SCOPED TO SCRIPT-LOCAL

 kCC_RemoveOptionalDeclarations
     VARIABLES NOT NEEDED TO SATISFY STRICT COMPILATION WILL NOT BE DECLARED (MOSTLY STYLISTIC)

 kCC_RemoveUnusedDeclarations
     VARIABLES THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE CODE TO WHICH THEY ARE SCOPED WILL BE REMOVED

 kCC_TidyCode
     REMOVE UNNECESSARY TRAILING SPACES FROM SCRIPT
     ~15% SLOWDOWN, BUT MAKES CODE DIFFS MUCH EASIER BETWEEN DEVELOPERS

 kCC_ZapGremlins
     ASCII CHARACTERS BETWEEN 0 AND 31 INCLUSIVE WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CODE BEFORE CLEANING
     ~2.5% SLOWDOWN
